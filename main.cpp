/** TODO
 * ">using a dedicated tool to maintain a TODO list" edition
 *
 * QRC FILES DO YOU EVEN INTO THEM ? Fix it soon for packaging and Urras.
 * Most cameras use YUYV, implement YUYV -> YUV240
 * Sending large files (~380MB) "restarts" after ~10MB. Goes back to 0%, consumes twice as much ram (reloads the file?)
 * => Don't load the whole file at once, load small chunks (25MB?) when needed, then free them and load the next
 * Sort the friend list by status, online first then busy then offline
 * Don't do anything if a friend is disconnected, don't print to the chat
 * Changing online/away/busy/offline by clicking the bubble
 * /me action messages
 * Popup windows for adding friends and changing settings
 * And logging of the chat
 * Show the picture's size between name and size after transfer completion if it's a pic
 * Adjust all status icons to match the mockup, including scooting the friendslist ones to the left and making the user one the same size
 * Sidepanel (friendlist) should be resizeable
 * An extra side panel for groupchats, like Venom does (?)
 *
 * In the file transfer widget:
 * >There is more padding on the left side compared to the right.
 * >Maybe put the file size should be in the same row as the name.
 * >Right-align the ETA.
