  protocols, whichever is available. If disabled, qTox will only use IPv4.

  If disabled, qTox will only use TCP, which lowers the amount of open
  connections and slightly decreases required bandwidth, but is also slower and
  puts more load on other network participants.

router or connection, you can try to disable them.

## Groupchats

you are standing together in a group. To create a groupchat click the groupchat
icon in the bottom left corner and set a name. Now you can invite your contacts
by right-clicking on the contact and selecting "Invite to group". Currently, if
the last person leaves the chat, it is closed and you have to create a new one.
Videochats and file transfers are currently unsupported in groupchats.

## Message Styling

Similar to other messaging applications, qTox supports stylized text formatting.

* For **Bold**, surround text in single or double asterisks: `*text*`
 or `**text**`
* For **Italics**, surround text in single or double forward slashes: `/text/`
 or `//text//`
* For **Strikethrough**, surround text in single or double tilde's: `~text~`
 or `~~text~~`
* For **Underline**, surround text in single or double underscores: `_text_`
 or `__text__`
* For **Code**, surround your code in in single backticks: `` `text` ``

Additionally, qTox supports three modes of Markdown parsing:

* `Plaintext`: No text is stylized
* `Show Formatting Characters`: Stylize text while showing formatting characters
  (Default)
* `Don't Show Formatting Characters`: Stylize text without showing formatting
  characters

*Note that any change in Markdown preference will require a restart.*

qTox also supports action messages by prefixing a message with `/me`, where
`/me` is replaced with your current username. For example `/me likes cats`
turns into *` * qTox User likes cats`*.

## Quotes

qTox has feature to quote selected text in chat window:

1. Select the text you want to quote.
2. Right-click on the selected text and choose "Quote selected text" in the
context menu. You also can use `ALT` + `q` shortcut.
3. Selected text will be automatically quoted into the message input area in a
pretty formatting.

## Friend- and Groupinvites

To invite a friend to a chat with you, you have to click the `+` button on the
bottom left of the qTox window. The "Add a friend" Tab allows you to enter the
Tox ID of your friend, or the username of a ToxMe service if your friend
registered there.

On the "Friend requests" tab you can see, friend requests you got from other
Tox users. You can then choose to either accept or decline these requests.

On the Groupinvites page, you can create a new groupchat and add users to it by
using the context menu in your contact list. Invites from your contacts are
also displayed here and you can accept and decline them.

## Multi Window Mode

In this mode, qTox will separate its main window into a single contact list and
one or multiple chat windows, which allows you to have multiple conversations on
your screen at the same time. Additionally you can manually group chats into a
window by dragging and dropping them onto each other. This mode can be activated
and configured in [settings](#settings).
