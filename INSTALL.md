----

Most of the dependencies should be available through your package manger. You
may either follow the directions below, or simply run `./simple_make.sh` after
cloning this repository, which will attempt to automatically download
dependencies followed by compilation.

### Install git
In order to clone the qTox repository you need Git.


<a name="arch-git" />

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git
```

<a name="debian-git" />

#### Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

<a name="fedora-git" />

#### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

<a name="opensuse-git" />

#### openSUSE

```bash
sudo zypper install git
```

<a name="ubuntu-git" />

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```


### Clone qTox

Afterwards open a new terminal, change to a directory of your choice and clone
the repository:

```bash
cd /home/$USER/qTox
git clone https://github.com/qTox/qTox.git qTox
```

The following steps assumes that you cloned the repository at
`/home/$USER/qTox`.  If you decided to choose another location, replace
corresponding parts.

### GCC, Qt, FFmpeg, OpanAL Soft and qrencode

<a name="arch-other-deps" />

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel qt5 openal libxss qrencode ffmpeg
```


<a name="debian-other-deps" />

#### Debian

**Note that only Debian >=8 stable (jessie) is supported.**

If you use Debian 8, you have to compile FFmpeg manually and add backports to
your `sources.list`. Adding backports:
http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    ffmpeg \
    libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev \
    libglib2.0-dev \
    libgtk2.0-dev \
    libopenal-dev \
    libqrencode-dev \

    qrencode \
    qt5-default \
    qt5-qmake \
    qttools5-dev \
    qttools5-dev-tools \
    yasm
```

**Go to [FFmpeg](#ffmpeg) section to compile it.**


<a name="fedora-other-deps" />

#### Fedora

**Note that sqlcipher is not included in all versions of Fedora yet.**
As of writing this section (November 2016), Fedora 25 ships sqlcipher, but
Fedora 24 and older don't ship it yet.
**This means that if you can't install sqlcipher from repositories, you'll
have to compile it yourself, otherwise compiling qTox will fail.**

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" "C Development Tools and Libraries"
# (can also use sudo dnf install @"Development Tools")
sudo dnf install \
    ffmpeg-devel \
    gtk2-devel \
    libXScrnSaver-devel \

### FFmpeg

If you have installed FFmpeg earlier (i.e. you don't run Debian 8), skip this
section, and go directly to installing [**toxcore**](#toxcore-dependencies).

To get ffmpeg compiled and put in directory `libs`, run this script in qTox
directory:

```bash
[ ! -e "libs" ] && mkdir libs   # create directory libs if doesn't exist
[ ! -e "ffmpeg" ] && mkdir ffmpeg

cd libs/
export PREFIX_DIR="$PWD"

cd ../ffmpeg
wget http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-3.2.2.tar.bz2

            --disable-encoders


make -j$(nproc)
make install

cd ../../

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PWD/libs/lib/pkgconfig"
```


### toxcore dependencies

Install all of the toxcore dependencies.

<a name="arch-toxcore" />

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed opus libvpx libsodium
```

<a name="debian-toxcore" />

#### Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install libtool autotools-dev automake checkinstall check \
libopus-dev libvpx-dev libsodium-dev libavdevice-dev
```

<a name="fedora-toxcore" />

#### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install libtool autoconf automake check check-devel libsodium-devel \
opus-devel libvpx-devel
```

<a name="opensuse-toxcore" />

#### openSUSE

```bash
sudo zypper install libsodium-devel libvpx-devel libopus-devel \
patterns-openSUSE-devel_basis
```

<a name="slackware-toxcore" />

#### Slackware

List of all the toxcore dependencies and their SlackBuilds can be found
here: http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/network/toxcore/


<a name="ubuntu-toxcore" />

#### Ubuntu >=15.04

```bash
sudo apt-get install libtool autotools-dev automake checkinstall check \
libopus-dev libvpx-dev libsodium-dev
```


### sqlcipher

If you are not using an old version of Fedora, skip this section, and go
directly to compiling
[**toxcore**](#toxcore-compiling).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher
cd sqlcipher
./configure --enable-tempstore=yes CFLAGS="-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC" \
    LDFLAGS="-lcrypto"
make
sudo make install
cd ..
```

### Compile toxcore

Provided that you have all required dependencies installed, you can simply run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toktok/c-toxcore.git toxcore
cd toxcore
git checkout v0.1.2
autoreconf -if
./configure
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
echo '/usr/local/lib/' | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/locallib.conf
sudo ldconfig
```


### Compile qTox

**Make sure that all the dependencies are installed.**  If you experience
problems with compiling, it's most likely due to missing dependencies, so please
make sure that you did install *all of them*.

Run in qTox directory to compile:

```bash
cmake .
make
```

If you had to compile [FFmpeg](#ffmpeg) manually, run this script from qTox
directory before starting qTox:

```bash
cd libs/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD"
cd ../../
```

Now you can start compiled qTox with `./qtox`

Congratulations, you've compiled qTox `:)`


#### Debian / Ubuntu / Mint

If the compiling process stops with a missing dependency like:
`... libswscale/swscale.h missing` try:

```bash
apt-file search libswscale/swscale.h
```

And install the package that provides the missing file.
Start make again. Repeat if necessary until all dependencies are installed. If
you can, please note down all additional dependencies you had to install that
aren't listed here, and let us know what is missing `;)`


---

### Building packages

Alternately, qTox now has the experimental and probably-dodgy ability to package
itself (in `.deb` form natively, and `.rpm` form with
[alien](http://joeyh.name/code/alien/)).

After installing the required dependencies, run `bootstrap.sh` and then run the
`buildPackages.sh` script, found in the tools folder. It will automatically get
the packages necessary for building `.deb`s, so be prepared to type your
password for sudo.


<a name="osx" />

## OS X

Supported OS X versions: >=10.8.

Compiling qTox on OS X for development requires 3 tools:
[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/),
[Qt 5.4+](https://www.qt.io/qt5-4/) and [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

### Automated Script

You can now set up your OS X system to compile qTox automatically thanks to the
script in: `./osx/qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh`

This script can be run independently of the qTox repo and is all that's needed
to build from scratch on OS X.

To use this script you must launch terminal which can be found:
`Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app`

If you wish to lean more you can run `./qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh -h`

Note that the script will revert any non-committed changes to qTox repository
during the `update` phase.

#### First Run / Install

If you are running the script for the first time you will want to make sure your
system is ready. To do this simply run `./qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh -i` to
run you through the automated install set up.

After running the installation setup you are now ready to build qTox from
source, to do this simply run: `./qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh -b`

If there aren't any errors then you'll find a locally working qTox application
in your home folder under `~/qTox-Mac_Build`

#### Updating

If you want to update your application for testing purposes or you want to run a
nightly build setup then run: `./qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh -u` and follow
the prompts. (NOTE: If you know you updated the repos before running this hit Y)
followed by `./qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh -b` to build the application once
more. (NOTE: This will delete your previous build.)

#### Deploying

OS X requires an extra step to make the `qTox.app` file shareable on a system
that doesn't have the required libraries installed already.

If you want to share the build you've made with your other friends who use OS X
then simply run: `./qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh -d`

### Manual Compiling
#### Required Libraries

Install homebrew if you don't have it:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

First, let's install the dependencies available via `brew`.

```bash
brew install git ffmpeg qrencode libtool automake autoconf check qt5 libvpx \
opus sqlcipher libsodium
```

Next, install
[toxcore](https://github.com/toktok/c-toxcore/blob/master/INSTALL.md#osx)

Then, clone qTox:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qTox/qTox
```

Finally, copy all required files. Whenever you update your brew packages, you
may skip all of the above steps and simply run the following commands:

```bash
cd ./git/qTox
sudo bash bootstrap-osx.sh
```

#### Compiling

You can build qTox with Qt Creator
[seperate download](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-6) or
manually with cmake

With that; in your terminal you can compile qTox in the git dir:

```bash
cmake .
make
```

Or a cleaner method would be to:

```bash
cd ./git/dir/qTox
mkdir ./build
cd build
cmake ..
```

#### Deploying

If you compiled qTox properly you can now deploy the `qTox.app` that's created
where you built qTox so you can distribute the package.

Using your qt5 homebrew installation from the build directory:

```bash
/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.5.1_2/bin/macdeployqt ./qTox.app
```

#### Running qTox

You've got 2 choices, either click on the qTox app that suddenly exists, or do
the following:

```bash
qtox.app/Contents/MacOS/qtox
```

Enjoy the snazzy CLI output as your friends and family congratulate you on
becoming a hacker

<a name="windows" />

## Windows

The following instructions will allow you to compile qTox on Windows using the MSYS2 shell.

**WARNING NOTES**

 1. You need to have at least **6 GB** of HDD space because of the large
 size of of Qt5 (~800 MB to download and ~5 GB to extract).
 2. The resulting executable isn't a static build and **will run from MSYS2 shell only**!
 Static build is in progress.
 ⇒ TODO: Those instructions need to be added before this is merged

### MSYS2

First things first: You need to [download MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/) for your architecture
and install it on your computer. The default location directly on C:\ works just fine.

After installing open the `MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit` shell for 32 bit building or the `64-bit` one,
if you want to build qTox as an x64 executable.

In the opened console run this command to update MSYS2:

```bash
pacman -Syu
```

If it says something along the lines of `Terminate shell after update`, you should restart
the console after updating and run the update command above again to make sure it is fully
updated.

### Dependencies

In order to install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in your
`MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit` shell:

```bash
pacman -S git make autoconf automake-wrapper mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-qt5 \
mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-libtool mingw-w64-i686-ffmpeg mingw-w64-i686-libvpx \
mingw-w64-i686-opus mingw-w64-i686-openal mingw-w64-i686-qrencode mingw-w64-i686-libsodium \
mingw-w64-i686-sqlcipher
```

Or, if you want to build for x64, open the `MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit` shell and use this command:

```bash
pacman -S git make autoconf automake-wrapper mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 \
mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg mingw-w64-x86_64-libvpx \
mingw-w64-x86_64-opus mingw-w64-x86_64-openal mingw-w64-x86_64-qrencode mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium \
mingw-w64-x86_64-sqlcipher
```

### Cloning needed repos

Clone the qTox and c-toxcore repositories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qTox/qTox
cd qTox
git clone https://github.com/toktok/c-toxcore
```

### Compiling toxcore

The compilation process is similar to [compilation on Linux](#compile-toxcore),
but it's even simpler:

Checkout your repositories to the desired tag and start compiling:

```bash
cd c-toxcore
git checkout v0.1.6
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j$(nproc)
make install
```

### Compiling qTox

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"
make -j$(nproc)
```

Now you can test your newly built executable! Run `qtox.exe`:

```bash
./qtox.exe
```


## Compile-time switches

They are passed as an argument to the `cmake` command. E.g. a switch `SWITCH`
with the value `YES` would be passed to `cmake` in the following manner:

```bash
cmake -DSWITCH=yes
```

Switches:

- `SMILEYS`, values:
  - if not defined or an unsupported value is passed, all emoticon packs are
    included
  - `DISABLED` – don't include any emoticon packs, custom ones are still loaded
  - `MIN` – minimal support for emoticons, only a single emoticon pack is
    included
