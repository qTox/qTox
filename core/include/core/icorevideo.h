* @struct ToxYUVFrame
* @brief A simple structure to represent a ToxYUV video frame (corresponds to a frame encoded
* under format: AV_PIX_FMT_YUV420P [FFmpeg] or VPX_IMG_FMT_I420 [WebM]).
*
* This structure exists for convenience and code clarity when ferrying YUV420 frames from one
* source to another. The buffers pointed to by the struct should not be owned by the struct nor
* should they be freed from the struct, instead this struct functions only as a simple alias to a
* more complicated frame container.
