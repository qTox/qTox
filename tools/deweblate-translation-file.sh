# Script to run to clean up translations from Weblate.
#
# It detects whether current HEAD commit seems to be a translation from
# Weblate, and if it is, it proceeds to update the translation commit by
# amending it.
#
# Note: the script assumes:
#  * there is only 1 translation file modified
#  * translation commit strictly adheres to consistent commit naming used
#  * script is called from the root of repo
#
# If those assumptions aren't met, the end result won't be what you want.
