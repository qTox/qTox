/*
 * This family of classes represents an intent to make changes to
 * settings that need to be saved to disk after the changes have
 * been made. To use it, simply instantiate a local object before
 * making changes and let it fall out of scope afterwards.
 *
 * The motivation behind this design is to easily prevent cascading
 * changes from triggering multiple writes to disk. The destructor
 * function only makes a save call if the object being destroyed
 * was the last instance of its class alive.
 *
 * Think: "last one out closes the door."
