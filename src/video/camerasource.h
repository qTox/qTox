/**
 * This class is a wrapper to share a camera's captured video frames
 * It allows objects to suscribe and unsuscribe to the stream, starting
 * the camera and streaming new video frames only when needed.
 * This is a singleton, since we can only capture from one
 * camera at the same time without thread-safety issues.
 * The source is lazy in the sense that it will only keep the video
 * device open as long as there are subscribers, the source can be
 * open but the device closed if there are zero subscribers.
